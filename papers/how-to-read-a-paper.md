## Prelude

**If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will be rejected.**

**If a reader cannot understand the highlights after five minutes, the paper will never be read.**

## Three-Pass Approach

### The first pass: bird's-eye view (5-10 minutes)

1. Read the **title**, **abstract**, and **introduction**
1. Read the **section** and **sub-section headings**, but ignore the rest
1. Read the **conclusions**
1. Glance at **references**, ticking off the ones you've read
1. Answer the 5 Cs:
   - **Category**: What type of paper is this? Measurement, analysis, description of prototype?
   - **Context**: What papers is this related to? What is the theoretical foundation?
   - **Correctness**: Do the assumptions appear valid?
   - **Contributions**: What are the papers contributions?
   - **Clarity**: Is the paper well written?

### The second pass: get the gist (up to 1 hour)

- Read with greater care, noting
  - Key points
  - Graphics
  - Unread references
- Ignore
  - Details
  - Proofs

### The third pass: understand (1-5 hours)

- Try to virtually re-implement the paper
- Identify and challenge assumptions
- Reconstruct structure of paper from memory
- Identify:
  - Strengths and weaknesses
  - Implicit assumptions
  - Missing citations to relevant work
  - Potential issues with experimental/analytical techniques

## Literature Survey

1. Google scholar search, do first pass on results
1. Find shared citations and repeated author names, download these common papers
1. Go to websites of key researchers and see what they've published recently
1. Go to conferences where the aforementioned researchers published and look at proceedings, combine these with papers from step 2
1. Make two passes through the collected papers, and add any papers that these papers cite
