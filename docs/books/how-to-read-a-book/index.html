<ol>
  <li>Create a tentative bibliography of your subject by recourse to library
catalogues, advisors, and bibliographies in books.</li>
  <li>Inspect <em>all</em> of the books on the tentative bibliography to ascertain which
are germane to your subject, and also to acquire a clearer idea of the
subject.</li>

<ol>
  <li>Inspect the books already identified as relevant to your subject in Stage 1
in order to find the most relevant passages.</li>
  <li>Bring the authors to terms by constructing a neutral terminology of the
subject that all, or the great majority, of the authors can be interpreted
as employing, whether they actually employ the words or not.</li>
  <li>Establish a set of neutral propositions for all of the authors by framing a
set of questions to which all or most of the authors can be interpreted as
giving answers, whether they actually treat the questions explicitly or not.</li>
  <li>Define the issues, both major and minor ones, by ranging the opposing
answers of authors to the various questions on one side of an issue or
another. You should remember that an issue does not always exist explicitly
between or among authors, but that it sometimes has to be constructed by
interpretation of the authors’ views on matters that may not have been their
primary concern.</li>
  <li>Analyze the discussion by ordering the questions and issues in such a way as
to throw maximum light on the subject. More general issues should precede
less general ones, and relations among issues should be clearly indicated.</li>

<ul>
  <li>We do not need to know everything about something to understand it.</li>
  <li>Too many facts are often as much an obstacle as too few.</li>
  <li>A reader is like a catcher, and the medium is the style of the pitch.</li>
  <li>Goals of reading:

      <li><strong>Entertainment</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Information</strong></li>
      <li>
<strong>Understanding</strong> (focus of this)
        <ul>
          <li>Implies shock and puzzlement</li>
          <li>Initial inequality in understanding</li>

  <li>Many books are hardly worth skimming</li>
  <li>Some should be read quickly</li>

  <li>Speed reading is only valuable if what you have read is not worth reading</li>
  <li>Every book should be read no more slowly than it deservers, and no more
quickly than it can be read with satisfaction and comprehension</li>
  <li>Do not try to understand every word or page of a difficult book the first

<ul>
  <li>Active reading:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What is the book about as a whole?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>What is being said in detail, and how?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Is the book true, in whole or part?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>What of it?</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Books that are over your head weary you unless you cannot pull yourself up to
them; it’s not the stretching that tires you, but the frustration of
stretching unsuccessfully because you lack the skill to stretch effectively</li>
  <li>Annotate the book</li>
  <li>After finishing, outline the book from memory</li>
  <li>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>Structural</strong>: what is said</li>
      <li>
<strong>Conceptual</strong>: answers questions of truth and significance</li>
      <li>
<strong>Shape of the Discussion (dialectical)</strong>: the form of discussion used by a collection of authors</li>

  <li>Reading is like skiing: when done by an expert, it is graceful and
harmonious, and when done by a novice is awkward, frustrating, and slow.</li>

  <li>
<strong>Rule 3</strong>: Identify major components and their relations. Describe the book in its most reduced form.</li>

they wrote the book).</li>

<ul>
  <li>A term is a word used unambiguously</li>
  <li>One word can be the vehicle for many terms</li>
  <li>One term and be expressed by many words</li>
  <li>
<strong>Rule 5</strong>: Find the important words and through them come to terms with the author.</li>
  <li>The most important words are those that give you trouble</li>

<a class="anchor" href="#9-determining-an-authors-message" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>9. Determining an Author’s Message</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Typically, you must come to terms with an author before you can tell what they are proposing</li>
  <li>Propositions are opinion unless supported by reason</li>
  <li>Propositions are answers to questions</li>
  <li>Outlining and interpretation meet at the level of propositions and arguments</li>
  <li>
<strong>Rule 6</strong>: Mark the most important sentences in a book and discover the
propositions they contain.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Rule 7</strong>: Locate or construct the basic arguments of the book by finding
them in the connection of the sentences.</li>
  <li>Being perplexed and knowing that is essential to good reading.</li>
  <li>Wonder is the beginning of wisdom in learning from books as well as from nature.</li>
  <li>Don’t pause on sentences that interest you, but rather the ones that puzzle you.</li>
  <li>State the propositions in your own words.</li>
  <li>Much of the content in a book does not express an argument at all.</li>
  <li>Arguments:
    <ul>
      <li>Composed of statements</li>
      <li>Types: Particular to general and general to general</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pay attention to what the author assumes, declares self-evident, and can be proved</li>
  <li>
<strong>Rule 8</strong>: Find out what the author’s solutions are.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Come to terms with the author by interpreting his key words.</li>
  <li>Grasp the author’s leading propositions by dealing with his most important sentences.</li>
  <li>Know the author’s arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out
of, sequences of sentences.</li>
  <li>Determine which of his problems the author has solved, and which he has not;
and as to the latter, decide which the author knew he had failed to solve.</li>

<a class="anchor" href="#10-criticizing-a-book-fairly" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>10. Criticizing a Book Fairly</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Without intellectual etiquette, conversation is bickering rather than communication.</li>
  <li><strong>Read not to contradict and confute; nor to believe and take for granted;
nor to find talk and discourse; but to weigh and consider.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Do not begin to talk back until you have listened carefully and are sure you understand.</strong></li>
  <li>
<strong>Rule 9</strong>: Must be able to say “I understand” before “I agree,” “I disagree,” or “I suspend judgment”.</li>
  <li>To agree without understanding is inane.</li>
  <li>To disagree without understanding is impudent.</li>
  <li><strong>Ask critics to state your position for you.</strong></li>
  <li>
<strong>Rule 10</strong>: When you disagree, do so reasonably, and not disputatiously or contentiously.</li>
  <li>All conversations should be for the advancement of knowledge, not victory.</li>
  <li><strong>Many disputes can be resolved by the removal of misunderstanding or ignorance.</strong></li>
  <li>Problems arise through identification with opinions.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Rule 11</strong>: Respect the difference between knowledge and opinion by giving reasons for judgments.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Only by meeting, not merely following, an author’s arguments can one reach
meaningful agreement or disagreement.</li>
  <li>Acknowledge your biases.</li>
  <li>Make your assumptions explicit.</li>
  <li>Attempt impartiality.</li>
  <li><strong>If you have not been able to read a book sympathetically, your disagreement
with it is probably more contentious than civil.</strong></li>
  <li>After “I understand but I disagree,” there are 4 possible remarks:
    <ol>
      <li>You are uninformed.</li>
      <li>You are misinformed.</li>
      <li>You are illogical – your reasoning is not cogent.</li>
      <li>Your analysis is incomplete.</li>

<ol>
  <li>Create a tentative bibliography of your subject by recourse to library

are germane to your subject, and also to acquire a clearer idea of the

<ol>
  <li>Inspect the books already identified as relevant to your subject in Stage 1
in order to find the most relevant passages.</li>
  <li>Bring the authors to terms by constructing a neutral terminology of the
subject that all, or the great majority, of the authors can be interpreted
as employing, whether they actually employ the words or not.</li>
  <li>Establish a set of neutral propositions for all of the authors by framing a
set of questions to which all or most of the authors can be interpreted as
giving answers, whether they actually treat the questions explicitly or not.</li>
  <li>Define the issues, both major and minor ones, by ranging the opposing
answers of authors to the various questions on one side of an issue or
another. You should remember that an issue doe snot always exist explicitly
between or among authors, but that it sometimes has to be constructed by
interpretation of the authors’ views on matters that may not have been their
primary concern.</li>
  <li>Analyze the discussion by ordering the questions and issues in such a way as
to throw maximum light on the subject. More general issues should precede
less general ones, and relations among issues should be clearly indicated.</li>
