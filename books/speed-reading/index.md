**tl;dr**: most of this is [debunked](https://www.wired.com/2017/01/make-resolution-read-speed-reading-wont-help/), but combining with content from [_How to Read a Book_](how-to-read-a-book) and [_How to Read a Paper_](../papers/how-to-read-a-paper), one might identify the following themes:

1. Identify your purpose and read the content with that aim.
1. Build a framework for understanding (outline the work).
1. Improve skimming, i.e. identify relevant/key sections/facts/ideas.
1. Ignore details/proofs, i.e. reduce fixations and regressions on early passes.
1. Attempt to recall structure and key points from memory.
