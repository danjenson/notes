# 1. Helping the student

# 2. Questions, recommendations, mental operations

# 3. Generality

# 4. Common Sense

# 5. Teacher and student. Imitation and practice

- Solving problems is a practical skill like swimming; we acquire any practical
  skill by imitation and practice.

# 6. Four phases

1. We have to understand the problem, to clearly see what is required.
2. We have to see how the various items are connected.
3. Carry out a plan.
4. Look back at the solution, review and discuss it.

# 7. Understanding the problem

- It is foolish to answer a question that you do not understand. It is sad to
  work for an end that you do not desire.

# 8. Example

# 9. Devising a plan

- We have a plan when we know, or at least know in outline, which calculations,
  computations, or constructions we have to perform in order to obtain the
  unknown.
- The way from understanding the problem to conceiving a plan may be long and
  tortuous.
- Good ideas are based on past experience and formerly acquired knowledge.
- Look at the unknown! And try to think of a familiar problem having the same or
  a similar unknown.
- If you cannot solve the proposed problem, try to solve first some related
  problem.

# 10. Example

# 11. Carrying out the plan

# 12. Example

# 13. Looking back

- By looking back at the completed solution, by reconsidering and reexamining
  the result and the path that led to it, they could consolidate their knowledge
  and develop their ability to solve problems.
- We could improve any solution and we can always improve our understanding of
  the solution.

# 14. Example

# 15. Various approaches

# 16. The teacher's method of questioning

- Begin with a general question or suggestion of our list, and, if necessary,
  come down gradually to more specific and concrete questions or suggestions
  until you reach one which elicits a response in the student's mind.

# 17. Good questions and bad questions

# 18. A problem of construction

# 19. A problem to prove

# 20. A rate problem
