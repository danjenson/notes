# Analogy

- **Analogy** is a sort of similarity. Similar objects agree with each other in
  some respect, _analogous objects agree in certain relations of their respective
  parts_.
- **Inference by analogy**: knowing that two objects are alike, conjecture that
  they are alike in one more respect.
- An analogical conclusion from many parallel cases is stronger than one from
  fewer cases, yet quality is still more important than quantity.
- Example: a rectangular parallelogram is analogous to a rectangular parallelepiped.
- 3 cases in which analogy attains the precision of mathematical ideas:
  1. Two systems of mathematical objects, say $S$ and $S'$, are so connected
     that certain relations between the objects of $S$ are governed by the same
     laws as those between objects of $S'$.
  2. There a one-to-one correspondence between the objects of two systems $S$
     and $S'$, preserving certain relations. That is, if such a relation holds
     between objects of one system, the same relation holds between the
     corresponding objects of the other system. This is called isomorphism.
  3. There is a one-to-many correspondence between the objects of the two
     systems $S$ and $S'$ preserving certain relations. This is called
     merohedral isomorphism.

# Auxiliary elements

- There are several types of auxiliary elements:
  - Components, e.g. lines
  - Unknowns
  - Theorems
  - Problems
- Can we introduce an auxiliary element in order to make a previous problem or
  theorem applicable?
- Mathematics is interesting in so far as it occupies our reasoning and
  inventive powers; there is nothing to learn about reasoning and invention if
  the motive and purpose of the most conspicuous step remain incomprehensible.
- **Auxiliary problems**: we hope that its consideration may able to help consider our
  original problem. Humans are better than flies because they can move around
  direct obstacles
  - To raise a clear-cut new problem subservient to another problem, to
    conceive distinctly as an end what is means to another end, is a refined
    achievement of the intelligence.
  - We may adopt the _result_ or _method_ of the auxiliary problem.
  - We are often led to the auxiliary problem by looking at the unknown and
    variation of the problem.
  - The passage from the original problem to the auxiliary problem is called
    _convertible_ reduction, or _bilateral_ reduction, or _equivalent_ reduction
    if these two problems, the original and auxiliary, are equivalent.
  - Chains of equivalent auxiliary problems are common in mathematical
    reasoning. We may find that A is equivalent to another problem B.
    Considering B we may run into a third problem C equivalent to B. Proceeding
    the same way, we reduce C to D, and so on, until we come upon a last problem
    L whose solution is known or immediate.
  - If, from a proposed problem we pass either to a more ambitious or to a less
    ambitious auxiliary problem we call the step a _unilateral reduction_.
  - Sometimes, the more ambitious problem may be more accessible; this is called
    the Inventor's Paradox.

# Bolzano

# Bright idea

- The sudden illumination of an idea that solves the problem. Many regard this
  as an act of sagacity, which Aristotle defines, "Sagacity is a hitting by
  guess upon the essential connection in an inappreciable time. As for example,
  if you see a person talking with a rich man in a certain way, you may
  instantly guess that that person is trying to borrow money. Or observing that
  the bright side of the moon is always toward the sun, you may suddenly
  perceive why this is; namely, because the moon shines by the light of the sun."
  - Polya considers the latter to be quite a flash of genius
