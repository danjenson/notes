# Analogy

- **Analogy** is a sort of similarity. Similar objects agree with each other in
  some respect, _analogous objects agree in certain relations of their respective
  parts_.
- **Inference by analogy**: knowing that two objects are alike, conjecture that
  they are alike in one more respect.
- An analogical conclusion from many parallel cases is stronger than one from
  fewer cases, yet quality is still more important than quantity.
- Example: a rectangular parallelogram is analogous to a rectangular parallelepiped.
- 3 cases in which analogy attains the precision of mathematical ideas:
  1. Two systems of mathematical objects, say $S$ and $S'$, are so connected
     that certain relations between the objects of $S$ are governed by the same
     laws as those between objects of $S'$.
  2. There a one-to-one correspondence between the objects of two systems $S$
     and $S'$, preserving certain relations. That is, if such a relation holds
     between objects of one system, the same relation holds between the
     corresponding objects of the other system. This is called isomorphism.
  3. There is a one-to-many correspondence between the objects of the two
     systems $S$ and $S'$ preserving certain relations. This is called
     merohedral isomorphism.
