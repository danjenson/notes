# Getting Acquainted

- _Where should I start?_ The problem statement.
- _What can I do?_ Visualize the problem as a whole as clearly and vividly as
  you can. Do not concern yourself with details.
- _What can I gain by doing so?_ You should understand the problem, familiarize
  yourself with it, impress its purpose upon your mind.

# Working for Better Understanding

- _What can I do?_ Isolate the principal parts of the problem. The hypothesis
  and the conclusion are the principal parts of the "problem to prove"; the
  unknown, the data, and the conditions are the principal parts of a "problem to
  find."

# Hunting for the Helpful Idea

- _What can I do?_ Consider your problem from various sides and seek contacts
  with your formerly acquired knowledge.

# Carrying Out the Plan

- _Where should I start?_ Start from the lucky idea that led you to the
  solution.

# Looking back

- _What can I do?_ Consider the solution from various sides and seek contacts
  with your formerly acquired knowledge.
- Survey more extensive parts of the solution and try to make them shorter; try
  to see the whole solution at a glance.
