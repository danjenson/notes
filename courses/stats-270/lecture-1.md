- Review of model, observations, likelihood.
- Review of unbiasedness, decision theory, and confidence interval.
- $F_\theta(\bar{y})$ is monotonically decreasing in $\theta$, i.e. $F_0(\bar{y})=1\to F_1(\bar{y})=0$.
- Review of discrete probability mass functions (pmfs).
- Nuisance parameters can complicate taking confidence intervals.
- The posterior depends only on the likelihood.
- Nuisance parameters can be marginalized out through integration.
